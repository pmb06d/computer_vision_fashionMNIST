# Introduction
The purpose of this lab is to compare the performance of several different machine learning algorithms in identifying items of clothing via the Fashion MNIST dataset. This dataset is currently used as a benchmark for computer vision problems since modern neural networks and classic machine learning algorithms can achieve high accuracy on the classic MNIST dataset out of the box.

# Methodology
The Fashion-MNIST dataset was obtained from Keras, a high-level API for TensorFlow. It consists of a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples. Each example is a 28x28 grayscale image, associated with a label from 10 classes.
